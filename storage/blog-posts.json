                "<p>Me, writing this post, means that I've made it in the third and final year of my bachelor education at Howest. What a road it has been! Each of my semesters consisted out of diverse courses, labs and projects of which this blog / portfolio is one.</p>",
                "<p>For the course <em>Professional Networking</em> we received the assignment to attend multiple events that have to do with the education and write our findings down in a selfmade blog in a professional manner. So here it is!</p>",
                "<p>Setting up this project, I wanted to have as much control as possible and use my acquired skills in web development and server management to the fullest. So I decided to use an on-premise web server and do all configuration on my own.</p>",
                "<p>All went smooth. Downloading and installing the necessary software, figuring out all configurations and of course, making the whole system as secure as possible. Before I knew it, I had the thing up and running locally. Next up, making sure that my visitors and I have access from all around the globe. Shouldn't be much of a deal right? Just create some port forwards and we're good to go. Unfortunately, I was wrong.</p>",
                "<p>Forwarding for my SSH connection and a Minecraft server I had running were working fine, but for some reason, I just couldn't get ports 80 and 443 to open which are required to access my website. And so I began the debugging process. After a lot of head scratching, testing different ports, messing with configurations and blaming my precious server, I finally reached out to the helpdesk and forum of my ISP. The helpdesk had no clue what I was talking about ofcourse but the forum gave a clue about a setting in the mobile app of the ISP in which you can make some minor configurations of your devices.</p>",
                "<p>I reached out to my mom, searched her client ID of the provider and made her an account for the app. There it finally was! A button to configure the \"security\" of my router. High security meant that ports 80, 443 and 445 were impossible to open... I placed it on low security and a reboot later I could access my website from the internet. Sigh..</p>",
                "<p>Don't get me wrong. I appreciate that my ISP does its best to secure its devices and protect its clients and they do a good job at that compared to other cases I've encountered but I think that anyone who finds theirselves in the port forwarding settings, opening port 80 and/or 443, knows what they are doing. I could be severely wrong about that but at least the helpdesk should have a clue about the existence of this option. ISPs am I right?</p>",
                "<p>And so I could start creating the layout of my portfolio, writing my blog posts and share my experiences with you! Feel free to check out my <a href='https://github.com/MartienskieNum1' target='_blank'>GitHub</a> account too where also the source code of this portfolio can be found ;)</p>"

During this challenge, the students need to find solutions for \"puzzles\" in a wide range of topics like cryptography, reverse engineering, network security, web or mobile application security, steganography, wireless and forensics analysis.</p>",
                "<p>Being my first hackathon, I was pretty nervous and didn't know what to expect, and whether it was worth skipping a few lessons since I had only just begun my education. Fortunately, I had a bunch of good friends by my side with whom a good time was guaranteed!</p>",
                "<p>We had to prepare ourselves for the all-nighter we were about to commit, so we stocked up on drinks, snacks and some banging playlists to survive the night. And so it began, from the beginning until the end, we did research, scanned networks, gazed upon code, images and soundwave forms, put our heads together for hours on end to score as high as possible in the leaderboard.</p>",
                "<p>Despite our best efforts, Vulpes, our group, ended in the 124th place out of the 204 who participated. However, it didn't feel like a defeat! We were more than satisfied with how far we had come and the newly gathered knowledge. We were hyped to participate again next year to apply our now more superior hacking experience!</p>"

                "<p>Coming into my second Cyber Security Challenge, I had a whole different feeling about this years edition. I was less stressed, because I did know what kind of challenges and puzzles to expect, covering which topics and probably because this time I knew that it was totally worth my time and sleep. The only thing I felt on my mind was that I was curious to know how big an impact my first year of IT experience, education and projects would have on my ability to solve these challenges and on our end result.</p>",
                "<p>We had a good start. We were finding flags at a good pace and wriggled our way up the leaderboard. At one point, at the end of the first day when we suddenly got a lot of flags, we even got into the top 10! This was an enormous morale boost to keep it up and we saw a chance to get into the next round. However, there was still a lot of time left. We decided, on this high, to get a bit of sleep.</p>",
                "<p>After two hours or so, we got back to work. We checked our placement and saw that we were kicked out of the top 10 but not by much. We eagerly got back to finding those precious flags expecting that we would be back in the run in no time. How we were wrong... The second \"day\", we only found one flag. Slowly but surely, our placement sank down, but not our perseverance!</p>",
                "<p>We kept looking and looking but with no results. At the end, we became somewhat desperate and thus we began solving puzzles manually which were supposed to be solved by scripting. Like manually noting down 1s and 0s based on long and short beeps in a wav file in an attempt to create a png file. We got to half of it but ran out of time. I still think that if we would've done the other half, we would've found it!</p>",
                "<p>And so the CSC came to an end. Our group, the Byte Busters, was placed 71st out of the 171 participating. Somewhat dissapointed that we couldn't make it in the second round but very proud of our improved result in comparison with past year. We'll be back next year!</p>"

                "<p>Toreon is a Belgian digital security company dealing with six areas: Cloud Security; Ethical Hacking; Governance, Risk and Compliance; Security Architecture; Secure Development and Threat Modeling. It is about these six domains that we were educated, about what exactly they mean in the work field and their importance.</p>",
                "<p>The day started early because of the train we had to catch to Antwerp where Toreon is located. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the head of HR and received a nicely equipped goodybag. We were then welcomed on the top floor where the cafeteria and seating hook are located. In these rooms, we could enjoy diverse drinks, fruit and gingerbread and have an interesting chat with the staff. We even came across an old friend with whom we shared a student house and is now working at Toreon.</p>",
                "<p>During the input session, we didn't learn a lot of new practical stuff but that also wasn't quite the objective of this day. We got to see what the people at Toreon are exactly working on and what a job at Toreon would look like.</p>",
                "<p>I personally found the input about ethical hacking the most interesting because that's also the domain in which I'd like to focus my further career (at this point at least). The input was called \"From 0 to Full Domain Admin\" where we learned to exploit the LLMNR protocol which is used by Windows machines to set-up a connection with another machine more easily. It is an alternate method of host identification next to the usual DNS. The protocol searches for devices of which it has credentials saved. If a device gives a positive response, the source device will send it the credentials in the form of a username and NTLMv2 hash. These credentials can be intercepted by sniffing the network but also by pretending that you are the host that someone is looking for. The hash can then be brute forced locally.</p>",
                "<p>Things like these really blow my mind! Exploiting day-to-day protocols and processes that are used all the time without being noticed by anyone to get at information you aren't supposed to have is an occupation I'd like to spend a lot more time on and eventually master.</p>",
                "<p>A big thank you to Toreon for hosting this event which allowed me to have a chat with professionals and spark my interest in cyber security some more.</p>"

                "<p>Cyrille and I were asked by our university to represent Howest at this year's edition of Cybersec Europe in Brussels. Cybersec is a yearly conference where talkshows, Q&A sessions, workshops and webinars are organised together with an exhibition floor, with the latest innovations related to IT security, data management and cloud solutions.</p>",
                "<p>On the first day, we stood mainly in the Howest booth to inform anyone who might be interested in the life of two senior students who've studied in Bruges for the past three years. Then, to give a small example of what the subject matter entails, we present a demo that reflects a hypothetical scenario in which a person with bad intentions physically enters a company. This person sees an unattended, unlocked desktop and plugs in a bad USB which lets the desktop connect to a command and control server that now has full control over the system. The hacker in control of the server takes a beautiful picture of the person operating the pawned desktop and cracks the user's hash due to a weak password. These same credentials are then used to pivot to another system with top secret intel. Administrator access in only a few seconds.</p>",
                "<p>The next day, we participated in the first edition of the \"Next Generation Award\" where the goal is to present an innovative product which contributes to the future of the society. Four groups of students from different universities participated each with interesting ideas. Cyrille and I presented the live demo to the audience and jury who enjoyed the presentation and were both impressed and frightened at the same time as to how easily a system can be hacked. We didn't receive the award, which we saw coming, as we didn't present an innovative product but nontheless, we conveyed the message that cybersecurity specialists are indipensable for the future of a save society. The winning team pitched a passive scanner named \"Argus\" which checks all public domains of a business for vulnerabilities and actively scans a newly joined one. An automatic report is then produced.</p>",
                "<p>Outside of these activities, we also went looking around for other exhibitors who peaked our interest. For example, we ended up at the booth of the Belgian military with whom we had an interesting conversation about how they go about things and what it takes to join them. Joining them is by all means an open option for me. Another business had a noble cause to gather broken or old IT systems to then recycle or resell. For each laptop collected, 2m² of trees is planted. Furthermore, Cyrille and I went to the photo booth of Proximus to get some pictures taken with Spot the robot dog! We ended the day with a beer in the hand while having conversations with other cyber security enthousiasts.</p>",
                "<p>Cybersec was definitely the most interesting conference I went to this year! I'm planning to return next year and hopefully present a product that is worth winning the \"Next Generation Award\". Highly recommended!</p>"
